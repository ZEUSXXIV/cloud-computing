        <h2>Unlock Opportunities</h2>
        <p class="p1">
            Thanks to all the knowledge, skills and experience you’ll gain in college, you’ll be able to adapt to a
            greater variety of jobs and careers. Statistics show that a college diploma can help you:
        <ul>
            <li>Get a job</li>
            <li>Keep a job</li>
            <li>Make more money</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Become More Independent</h2>
        <p class="p1">
            College work will challenge and inspire you. In college, you will:
        <ul>
            <li>Explore subjects in greater depth than you did in high school</li>
            <li>Choose your own courses and class schedule</li>
            <li>Decide which extracurricular activities you’ll focus on — and how much time you’ll give them</li>
        </ul>
        College helps students develop into mature, responsible and independent adults. But you’re not entirely on your
        own: colleges offer students many kinds of help making this transition, such as tutoring and academic advising
        as well as counseling and other support.
        </p>
        <h2>Explore Your Options</h2>
        <p class="p1">
            One of the great things about being able to choose your own courses is that you get the opportunity to
            explore. You can try classes in a lot of different subjects, or you can dive right into a favorite subject.
            You may choose to begin training for a career right away. Or you may pick a major after taking some time to
            check out your options. Colleges offer classes and majors in subjects you’ve studied in high school — plus
            many more that you haven’t.
        </p>
        <h2>Invest in Yourself</h2>
        <p class="p1">
            As you take on college work and participate in college life, you’ll encounter new ideas and challenges.
            Along the way, you’ll:
        <ul>
            <li>Build knowledge, skills and brainpower</li>
            <li>Discover new passions</li>
            <li>Follow and satisfy your curiosity</li>
            <li>Learn more about yourself</li>
            <li>Bond with new friends</li>
            <li>Prepare for a future in which you’re better equipped to give back</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
